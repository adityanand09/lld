This project needs improvement, as the main dispatcher logic is not implemented. I will try to implement soon.
If anyone wants to improve please contact.

If you find any bug or better implementation or if you it can be implemented in a more simple manner you are free to contact over linkedin.

To run the application :

Windows :
	
	In command prompt run : mingw32-make (from the directory in which the app is)
	It will build the project files and creates a executable vehicle_rental_system.exe
	Launch vehicle_rental_system.exe

	NOTE : executable is built with debug symbols, you can debug using gdb.
